# LeanCode Core Library

LeanCode Core Library, or CoreLib for short, is a set of helper libraries developed at [our company](https://leancode.pl) that aids our day-to-day development. It also provides a general guidelines on how we should build our apps.

Our aim is to provide an opinionated framework for .NET Core app development. As for now we have, more-or-less, standardized:

* App startup, config & logging,
* Base DDD models & how it interacts with the rest of the framework,
* CQRS and CQRS-as-API,
* Basic localization,
* Some integrations with external services.

Even though is a framework, we try to stick to the ASP.NET Core model as close as possible and keep the "framework" part really small.
