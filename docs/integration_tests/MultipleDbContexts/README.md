# ConfigurationOverrides class

ConfigurationOverrides class provides a way to override configuration values at runtime using a dictionary of key-value pairs. The class has a dictionary field named `data` which stores the configuration key-value pairs that will be used to override the original configuration values.

The class has two public methods for adding key-value pairs to the data dictionary:

- `Add` : Adds a single key-value pair to the dictionary.
- `AddConnectionString` : Adds a connection string to the dictionary.
